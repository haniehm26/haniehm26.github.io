# About Me

I'm Hanieh! Right now I'm a master's student in **Computer Science** at **Sapienza University**. Before coming to Rome, I worked as a **Data Scientist** for 2 years in a company in Tehran. Before that, I did my bachelor’s in **Computer Engineering** at **Shahid Beheshti University**.

I enjoy learning new things, whether they are technical or not. I also like writing blog posts about the courses I study, because it helps me understand them better.

# My Blog Posts

I’ve always enjoyed writing, especially summarizing and writing about what was taught in lectures during high school and university. So I decided to level up this skill and write **technical blog posts** about the courses I want to learn more about and share them in **Virgool** (Persian version of Medium). I write in **Persian**, my mother tongue, because there isn’t much content like this in the Persian-Speaking community.  

So far, I’ve written about:

- **Machine Learning**  
- **Linear Algebra**  
- **Probability and Statistics**  

Right now, I’m doing a **Natural Language Processing** course and writing blog posts about it too.
